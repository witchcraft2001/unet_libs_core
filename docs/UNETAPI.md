# UNET - universal network DLL API

UNET is a backend-agnostic network interface delivered as a libman 1.3 / L1
DLL. One contract, two interchangeable backends:

- **UNETESP.DLL** - Sprinter-WiFi (ESP8266 running ESP-AT firmware). Shipped
  and implemented in this package. **Firmware: ESP-AT 2.2.2 only.** The DLL is
  built for the 2.2.2 command set with its complete trigger-4 receive path;
  it does not contain a 2.2.1 fallback. `NETINIT` returns `NERR_NONET` if the
  active NETUP session is not `NET_ESP_FW=2.2.2`, and its L1 header name reads
  `UNET ESP 2.2.2` (shown by UNETTEST). Run NETUP with 2.2.2 firmware first.
- **UNETRTL.DLL** - RTL8019A Ethernet card. Same function numbers and error
  codes; implemented separately in the sprinter-rtl8019a project (see the RTL
  appendix below).

Backends differ only in what they advertise through `GETCAPS`, never in the
function numbering. Both current backends advertise `CAP_MULTICHAN` (two
simultaneous connections): UNETESP since 0.3, UNETRTL since 0.2.5x. Always
gate on `GETCAPS` at run time rather than assuming a fixed set per backend -
that is the portable rule this API is built around.

A consumer written in asm, C or Pascal loads a backend with libman
(`l_load` / `l_call` / `l_free`) and drives TCP, UDP, resolve and ping through
the numbered functions. Because the ABI is identical across backends, one
consumer binary can talk to either card - pick the DLL by name at run time
(for example from the `NET` environment variable: `UNET` + backend tag).

The authoritative machine-readable contract is generated from
[abi/unet_abi.toml](../abi/unet_abi.toml) - see
[bindings/asm/unet.inc](../bindings/asm/unet.inc) (Solid C and Pascal
renderings live alongside it under `bindings/`). This document is the
prose reference and covers usage patterns the header cannot.

---

## Loading and the calling convention

libman is a consumer-side module (`l_load` / `l_call` / `l_free`), not a
resident service. The consumer embeds it (asm: `libman13.asm`; Pascal:
`LIBMAN.INC`) and calls:

```
    ld   hl,filename      ; "UNETESP.DLL",0
    ld   a,window         ; 1 (0x4000) or 2 (0x8000) - NEVER 3
    call l_load           ; -> HL = handle, CF=1 on error
    ...
    ld   hl,(handle)
    ld   b,function       ; UNET_FN_*
    call l_call
    ...
    ld   hl,(handle)
    call l_free
```

**DLL name resolution.** `l_load` opens the file through the DSS file API,
which resolves the name against the **current directory** only - it does not
search `PATH` or the consumer's own program directory. A consumer launched
through `PATH` from an unrelated directory will therefore fail to find a DLL
that sits next to its EXE. Two ways to be robust:

- Resolve the DLL beside your EXE first: call DSS `APPINFO`
  (`B = APPINFO_EXE_HOMEDIR`, `C = DSS_APPINFO`) to get your EXE's directory,
  append the DLL name, and pass that full path to `l_load`; fall back to the
  bare name if `APPINFO` is unavailable. `UNETTEST` does exactly this
  (`RESOLVE_DLL_PATH` in `src/apps/unettest.asm`, mirroring `NETUP`'s NET.CFG
  lookup).
- Or simply run the consumer from the directory that holds the DLL, or pass a
  full path.

**Failure diagnostics (vendored libman extension).** After `l_load` returns
`CF=1`, the Sprinter-ESP-Kit copy of libman publishes two bytes so a consumer
can report *why* the load failed (these are not in stock libman 1.3, and are
valid only when `l_load` returned an error):

- `LIBMAN.l_reason` - the failing stage: `LR_MEMORY`, `LR_OPEN`, `LR_IO`,
  `LR_FORMAT`, `LR_INIT`, `LR_LIMIT`, `LR_CALL`.
- `LIBMAN.l_dsserr` - the raw DSS error code at that stage (e.g. 3 = file not
  found, 4 = path not found, 30 = no free memory), or the DLL's INIT refusal
  code for `LR_INIT`. `LR_CALL` distinguishes a malformed internal table/window
  from a DSS `SETWIN` failure instead of misreporting either as an INIT refusal.

The vendored dispatcher intentionally maps calls through the explicit DSS
`SETWIN1`/`SETWIN2`/`SETWIN3` functions, not generic `SETWIN` (`0x38`).
Current Estex-DSS computes the generic function's slot port with `0x42` where
`0x82` is required, so it can report success without mapping the DLL into the
requested window. The explicit functions use the proper `SLOT1`/`SLOT2`/
`SLOT3` constants and work on both old and current DSS implementations.

Register discipline for every UNET function:

- Arguments are passed **only in A, DE, IX, IY**. HL and BC are consumed by the
  libman dispatcher. The vendored dispatcher saves IX/IY around its internal
  DSS `SETWINn` call; stock libman 1.3 does not, although DSS/BIOS is allowed
  to clobber index registers.
- Results come back in **A, DE, IX, IY**.
- **Every function returns its status in A** (0 = `NERR_OK`, else a `NERR_*`
  code). The dispatcher does **not** propagate a user function's carry flag, so
  test A, never CF.
- The library is not reentrant; make one call at a time.

### Window and buffer rules (important)

- Load the DLL into **window 1 (0x4000) or window 2 (0x8000) only.** Never
  window 3 (0xC000): the ESP backend maps its ISA UART there during every call
  and would swap its own code out. The DLL's load hook detects window 3 and
  refuses to load (`l_load` fails). (The old Solid-C `loaddll` hard-codes
  window 3 and is therefore incompatible.)
- All caller buffers (host/port strings, send/recv payload, GETINFO/LASTERR
  destinations) must live **below 0xC000 and outside the 16 KB window the DLL
  was loaded into** - the whole buffer, not just its first byte: both ends of
  the range (`buf .. buf+len-1`, or the string terminator) are validated.
  Violations return `NERR_PARAM`.
- Pointers in **window 0 (`0x0000..0x3FFF`) are accepted**. The DLL does not
  verify which page is mapped there. If a program replaces the DSS/system page
  with its own page, preserving and restoring that mapping safely is entirely
  the caller's responsibility.
- Host strings are limited to **128 bytes** and port strings to **15 bytes**
  (longer arguments return `NERR_PARAM`); this protects the DLL's fixed-size
  AT command build buffers.
- Keep at least ~256 bytes of free stack across a call. libman's loader and the
  ESP receive path both use the caller's stack.
- Which window to use:
  - A consumer whose own code sits at 0x8100 (window 2 - most SDCC C programs,
    and the light DSS utilities) loads the DLL into **window 1**.
  - A consumer whose code sits at 0x4100 (window 1 - Turbo Pascal built with
    `/D:8000`) loads the DLL into **window 2**.

`host` and `port` are NUL-terminated ASCII strings (e.g. `"example.com",0` and
`"80",0`).

The channel byte selects one of two independent connections. A backend that
reports `CAP_MULTICHAN` accepts channel 0 and channel 1 and can hold both open
at the same time; one without it accepts only channel 0. Any other value returns
`NERR_PARAM`. Always gate on the capability bit rather than the backend name -
both current backends advertise it (UNETESP since 0.3, UNETRTL since 0.2.5x),
but a future or older backend might not. See
"[Two channels](#two-channels)" below.

`NETINIT` must be called (and succeed) before `CONNECT`, `UDPOPEN`, `RESOLVE`
or `PING`; otherwise those return `NERR_STATE`.

### Function 0 / 1 - INIT / FINI

libman calls these at load and free. Do not call them directly. INIT verifies
the DLL was not loaded into window 3; FINI closes any still-open link.

### Function 2 - GETCAPS

Returns the capability bitmask in DE and the ABI version (`major<<8|minor`) in
IX. Callable before `NETINIT`. Check the ABI major byte before relying on the
numbered functions. UNETESP 0.3.0 reports `0x033F` =
`TCP | UDP | RESOLVE | PING | MULTICHAN | LISTEN | RXFLOW | ASYNCSEND`; UNETRTL
0.3.0 reports `0x023F`, without `RXFLOW`. The ABI version stays `0x0100`:
capabilities, including inbound sockets, are discovered through bits rather
than version bumps.

### Function 3 - NETINIT

Brings the link layer up: verifies the network was configured (see
"Network up" below), finds and initialises the UART at the configured baud,
probes the ESP (resetting it once if silent), enables RTS/CTS flow control on
both sides, clears any leftover socket and selects multi-connection mode
(`AT+CIPMUX=1`). The socket cleanup must precede the mode switch - ESP-AT
rejects `AT+CIPMUX` while a link is open - and because it really closes any
open link, NETINIT also resets both channels' state, so a repeated `NETINIT`
followed by `CONNECT` is safe.

After the mode switch NETINIT sends `AT+CIPTCPOPT=5,-1,0,4000` (best effort:
an `ERROR` is tolerated). This bounds the firmware's internal TCP send with a
4 s `SO_SNDTIMEO`. Without it - the firmware default is *no* timeout - ESP-AT
v2.2.2 holds its socket mutex across a blocking `lwip_send`, and because
`+IPD` printing needs the same mutex, one send stalled by Wi-Fi
retransmissions silences the module's entire UART output (prompts, `SEND OK`
and the inbound stream alike) until the send completes; verified in the
`v2.2.2.0_esp8266` core (`at_sending_data` / `at_process_recv_socket` /
`s_at_socket_mutex`). With the option set, a stuck send ends in the module's
own `SEND FAIL` within 4 s - before the DLL's 5 s client timeout - and the
stream resumes.
Returns `NERR_OK`, `NERR_NONET` (not configured), `NERR_HW` (no card / no
response) or `NERR_BUSY` (ESP IP stack still warming up after join).

### Function 4 / 8 - NETDONE / CLOSE

`CLOSE` closes **one** channel and is idempotent. Data still buffered for that
channel is discarded: to shut down gracefully, read until `NERR_CLOSED` first.

`NETDONE` closes every channel and hands the ESP back in single-connection mode
(`AT+CIPMUX=0`), which is what the stock utilities (WGET, FTP, TELNET, ...)
expect to find. The network itself stays up, so a later `CONNECT` still works -
it re-arms multi-connection mode by itself.

### Function 5 - CONNECT

Opens a TCP connection to `host:port` on the given channel. Retries internally
while the ESP reports `busy` (its IP stack may still be warming up right after
`NETUP`). `NERR_STATE` if that channel is already open (the other channel's
state does not matter), `NERR_DNS` if the name could not be resolved by the ESP,
`NERR_CANCEL` if the user cancelled a pending connect (with `CANCELKEYS` on),
`NERR_CONNECT` for any other failure.

Opening a channel clears whatever was buffered for it, so a new link never
replays the previous one's data. The other channel is untouched.

`CIPSTART` is parsed with the same link-aware binary reader as SEND. Its own
`<id>,CONNECT` is the definitive success event; the DLL does not wait for the
following `OK`, because an immediately streaming peer can keep continuous
`+IPD` ahead of that command tail. Any `+IPD` arriving before `CONNECT` is
stashed for the new channel; data after it remains on the UART and is delivered
by the first RECV instead of being consumed as command text. A stale bare `OK`
or a `CONNECT` notification for another link cannot complete the open. RTS is
temporarily paused after the matching `CONNECT` and resumed by the first RECV
or SEND, preserving already queued FIFO bytes across the libman/application
return without allowing an immediate peer greeting to overrun the 16550.

### Function 6 - SEND

Sends `len` bytes. On a TCP channel the payload is split internally into
2048-byte chunks (the ESP-AT `CIPSEND` maximum), so callers pass the whole
buffer in one call. On a UDP channel each SEND is **one datagram**; lengths
over 1472 (the ESP-AT UDP payload cap) return `NERR_PARAM`. DE returns the
number of bytes actually sent, even on `NERR_SEND`/`NERR_CANCEL`.

Note: data arriving from the peer **while** a SEND is in flight may be dropped
by the ESP backend (see the interactive-stream pattern below); drain RECV
before sending when the peer may talk unprompted.

### Function 7 - RECV

Reads up to `max` bytes from one channel with an `IY` millisecond timeout.
`IY=0` is a bounded non-blocking poll: the ESP backend still performs its
initial UART spin window and internally clamps the timeout to one millisecond;
it never turns zero into a 65-second wait.
Returns:

- `A=NERR_OK, DE>0` - data received.
- `A=NERR_OK, DE=0` - nothing for this channel yet. Usually the timeout expired;
  with two channels it can also mean the backend buffered a block for the
  *other* channel and handed control straight back (flag bit3, below), so a
  caller does not sit behind the busy channel's stream.
- `A=NERR_CLOSED` - the peer closed the connection. **Any bytes already
  buffered are delivered first (DE>0, A=NERR_OK); the *next* call returns
  NERR_CLOSED with DE=0**, so a "FIN with a final data segment" never loses the
  tail. A close on one channel never affects the other.

IX returns status flags, all scoped to the channel just read:

| bit | meaning |
|-----|---------|
| 0 | oversized datagram was truncated (never set by UNETESP - the tail arrives on the next call with bit1 instead) |
| 1 | more data is already buffered for this channel; call RECV again |
| 2 | data was lost since the last RECV on this channel: a UART overrun (16550 LSR) or a buffered frame dropped on overflow |
| 3 | data is pending on the **other** channel (optional; UNETESP 0.3 and later) |

### Function 9 - STATUS

With `A` = a channel number, returns that channel's state in DE:

| bit | meaning |
|-----|---------|
| 0 (`0x01`) | channel is listening; `LISTEN` is armed and no peer has connected |
| 1 (`0x02`) | channel is connected (last known state) |
| 2 (`0x04`) | received data is buffered for it and not delivered yet (optional; only backends with `CAP_MULTICHAN` set it, so treat "clear" as "unknown" rather than "empty") |
| 3 (`0x08`) | connection was accepted through `LISTEN`; always set with bit 1 |

STATUS reads memory only - it never touches the UART, so it is cheap enough to
poll between other work. A channel whose peer has closed reports the pending bit
without the connected bit, which is the cue to keep reading until `NERR_CLOSED`.
Bit 0 belongs only to this per-channel form; the `A=0xFF` form uses it for the
unrelated "environment configured" state.

With `A = 0xFF`, returns network status **without touching the hardware**:
`A = NERR_OK` / `NERR_NONET`, and DE bit0 = the network is configured (env
published), bit1 = `NETINIT` has completed. Useful for a launcher that wants to
show status cheaply.

### Function 11 - RESOLVE

Resolves a host name to a dotted-quad string in the caller's `dest` buffer
(>= 16 bytes). On firmware that lacks `AT+CIPDOMAIN` (and on the current
jesperl emulator) this returns `NERR_NOTSUP`; the result is cached so later
calls fail fast. `GETCAPS` still advertises `RESOLVE` because the capability is
a static driver property - test the return value at run time. Most consumers do
not need RESOLVE at all: `CONNECT` accepts a host name directly (the ESP
resolves it in firmware).

### Function 12 - PING

ICMP-style reachability check; DE returns the round-trip time in milliseconds.

### Functions 13 / 14 - RXPAUSE / RXRESUME

See "Avoiding UART overrun" below. Both return `NERR_STATE` before `NETINIT`:
until the UART has been located, a register write could poke a different ISA
card.

### Function 15 - GETINFO

Copies a network property string into `dest` (NUL-terminated, truncated to
`max`; `max=0` returns `NERR_PARAM`). Fields: 0 backend tag ("ESP"), 1 IP, 2 mask, 3 gateway, 4 MAC, 5 DNS1,
6 DNS2, 7 IP source ("STATIC"/"DHCP"), 8 SSID, 9 baud, 10 NTP, 11 timezone,
12 hardware descriptor. Unset fields return an empty string. On UNETESP the
values come from the `NET_*` environment variables published by NETUP.

### Function 16 - LASTERR

Copies the **tail** of the last raw AT/driver response into `dest`: when the
response is longer than the buffer, the final bytes (the `ERROR`/`CLOSED`
line - the useful part) survive the truncation. `max=0` returns `NERR_PARAM`.
A diagnostic aid, like the ESP debug tail in the fido binkp client.

After a failed SEND the buffer instead holds

```
send failed <n>: <line>
```

because every transport failure maps to the single public status `NERR_SEND`.
`n` is the internal transport result (1 = ESP replied `ERROR`, 2 = `FAIL`,
3 = transmit timeout, 4 = no response); the optional line is the last complete
ESP response or recovery-probe line. The recovery probe still detects a late
`SEND OK` and module reboot exactly as before, but verbose byte counts,
first/tail capture, LSR formatting and textual probe verdicts are deliberately
not retained in the DLL image. This keeps `LASTERR` actionable while reserving
space for transport functionality.

Silent connect timeouts trigger a bounded recovery ladder: the DLL probes with
`AT` for up to ~10 s through the same +IPD-aware reader, reissues `CIPSTART`
once when command mode is proven alive, and accepts either a late target-link
`<id>,CONNECT` or `ALREADY CONNECTED` from that recovery retry as success. The
latter means the first attempt opened the same numbered link but its event was
lost; it is never accepted on an initial attempt, where it could describe a
stale endpoint. For SEND the probe is safe only after the complete payload left
the host; it can accept a late `SEND OK` or detect a reboot, but never reissues
the payload. Before the `>` prompt even an `AT` probe could be consumed as
payload if the prompt was merely late, so that path fails closed without
probing.

### Function 17 - SETOPT

- `UNET_OPT_CANCELKEYS` (1): DE=1 enables Esc / Ctrl+Z polling during blocking
  UART loops (a cancelled receive returns `NERR_CANCEL`). Default off - the DLL
  never touches the keyboard unless asked.
- `UNET_OPT_RXTRIG` (2): DE = 1/4/8/14 sets the 16550 RX FIFO auto-RTS trigger
  level. Default 4. Use a different value only for field diagnostics on
  specific hardware (see the overrun note). Returns `NERR_STATE` before
  `NETINIT` (the UART base is not known yet).
- `UNET_OPT_SENDSLICE` (3): DE = milliseconds of link **silence** after which
  a SEND suspends with `NERR_AGAIN` instead of blocking. 0 (the default)
  keeps sends fully blocking; non-zero values are clamped to >= 50. Gate on
  `UNET_CAP_ASYNCSEND`. See "Non-blocking SEND" below.

### Functions 18 / 19 - LISTEN / UNLISTEN

Gate these functions on `UNET_CAP_LISTEN`. `LISTEN` takes a closed channel in
`A` and a local TCP port in `DE` as a **binary** 16-bit value (1..65535, not an
ASCIIZ string). Only one channel can listen; a second call returns
`NERR_STATE`. There is no accept call: poll `RECV` on the listening channel to
advance the incoming handshake. Once accepted, STATUS reports
`UNET_ST_CONN|UNET_ST_ACCEPT` and the channel behaves like an outbound
connection. Closing it re-arms the same listener and port. `UNLISTEN` stops
that re-arm; it leaves an already accepted connection open until `CLOSE`.

### Non-blocking SEND (CAP_ASYNCSEND, UNETESP/UNETRTL >= 0.3.0)

A `CIPSEND` is a transaction: once the command text is out, a second copy may
be swallowed as payload, so "time out and retry" is never safe. Instead the
DLL keeps the transaction alive across calls:

- With `UNET_OPT_SENDSLICE` set, a SEND whose link stays **silent** for one
  quantum returns `NERR_AGAIN` with `DE` = bytes confirmed so far. Nothing is
  retransmitted and nothing is lost - `+IPD` frames that arrive while the
  transaction is parked were already stashed for their channels.
- Repeat the **same** call (same channel, buffer, length) to continue; the
  wait resumes exactly where it stopped, including a half-matched `+IPD,`
  prefix or a half-received response line. A different channel or different
  arguments while a transaction is pending return `NERR_STATE`.
- Between repeats the consumer may run its UI, poll the keyboard, and call
  RECV/STATUS freely: while a send is suspended RECV serves only buffered
  data and returns immediately (never touching the live stream), and STATUS
  never touches hardware. `UNET_RXF_XCHAN`/`UNET_ST_RXPEND` still work.
- Functions that transmit AT text (CONNECT, UDPOPEN, CLOSE, NETDONE, PING,
  RESOLVE, NETINIT) return `NERR_BUSY` while a SEND is pending and do not touch
  the UART. Only the same SEND may advance the transaction: completing it from
  another API call would lose its byte-count result, and a later SEND retry
  would duplicate stream bytes. Finish the SEND before CLOSE/NETDONE/free; use
  the explicit `NETRESET` tool if the module never returns to command mode.
- As long as data keeps flowing the quantum never fires: the slice measures
  silence, not total duration. A stalled ESP simply yields `NERR_AGAIN` every
  quantum until the module recovers or the consumer gives up.
- Silence that falls **inside** a `+IPD` frame capture still uses the internal
  5 s per-byte timeout. The captured prefix is committed and the exact unread
  payload count remains live; a later RECV/SEND continuation resumes that
  binary frame before any new AT text is allowed onto the UART.

`RACETEST -a` exercises this mode end to end (slice 200 ms, ticks `~` per
suspension, continuity-checked as always).

## Error codes

`NERR_OK`=0, `NERR_HW`=1, `NERR_NONET`=2, `NERR_DNS`=3, `NERR_CONNECT`=4,
`NERR_SEND`=5, `NERR_RECV_TIMEOUT`=6, `NERR_CLOSED`=7, `NERR_CANCEL`=8,
`NERR_PARAM`=9, `NERR_NOTSUP`=10, `NERR_STATE`=11, `NERR_TIMEOUT`=12,
`NERR_BUSY`=13, `NERR_PROTO`=14, `NERR_AGAIN`=15 (suspended send - not an
error; see "Non-blocking SEND").

---

## Network up

Before a consumer uses the network, it must be brought up by the standard
tools, exactly as for the stand-alone utilities:

- **ESP:** run `NETUP` (it joins Wi-Fi and publishes `NET=WIFI`, `NET_ESP_HW`,
  `NET_ESP_FW`, `NET_ESP_FLOW`, `NET_IP`, `NET_BAUD`, ...). `NETINIT` checks `NET=="WIFI"`
  and `NET_ESP_HW` non-empty. `NET_ESP_FW` is `2.2.1` or `2.2.2`; consumers
  that add an ESP-AT passive-receive path must gate it on `2.2.2`.
  `NET_ESP_FLOW` is `3` or `0` and records the UART flow mode negotiated by
  NETUP; the ESP backend reproduces it locally without reconfiguring the ESP.
- **RTL:** run `NETCFG -i` (static) and/or `IFUP` (DHCP) so `NET_IP` and
  `NET_MAC` are published.

`STATUS` with `A=0xFF` reports this state without touching the card.

---

## Usage patterns

### Request / response (HTTP GET or POST)

Open, send the whole request, read the response until the peer closes, then
close. Works for a POST whose body is any size (SEND chunks internally):

```
    NETINIT
    CONNECT   chan 0, "example.com", "80"
    SEND      chan 0, request buffer (headers + body), length
loop:
    RECV      chan 0, buf, max, 5000 ms
    ; A=NERR_OK, DE>0 -> consume DE bytes, loop
    ; A=NERR_OK, DE=0 -> idle, loop or give up
    ; A=NERR_CLOSED   -> consume any DE bytes, then stop
    CLOSE     chan 0
    NETDONE
```

The "FIN with a final segment" guarantee (see RECV) means the last bytes before
the close are always delivered.

### Interactive bidirectional stream (IRC / telnet / chat)

The same SEND/RECV pair drives a full-duplex session - no special "transparent"
mode is needed, and the identical code runs on both backends. Poll with a short
RECV timeout so the loop stays responsive:

```
    CONNECT   chan 0, host, port
loop:
    RECV      chan 0, buf, max, 150 ms   ; A=NERR_OK/DE=0 means "nothing yet, still alive"
    ; render received bytes; RXPAUSE around slow screen/disk work (see below)
    ; if the user typed something: SEND chan 0, line, len
    ; A=NERR_CLOSED -> session ended
    jr loop
```

**Data arriving during a SEND.** A peer frame can arrive between the `CIPSEND`
prompt and `SEND OK` (a window of a few tens of milliseconds per send). The ESP
send path parses *past* such interleaved `+IPD` frames without corrupting the
protocol state, and **UNETESP captures their payload into a 2 KB defer buffer
and replays it to the next RECV, in arrival order, ahead of any live data** -
so the race no longer loses bytes. A peer that only speaks when spoken to
(HTTP, NTP, most protocols) never enters the window; genuinely full-duplex peers
(chat, telnet server-push, binkp) are now handled losslessly without special
care. Notes:

- After a RECV that drained the defer buffer, `IX` bit1 is set while more
  captured (or live-partial) data remains - keep calling RECV, exactly as for a
  normal multi-frame read.
- If a single racing frame is larger than the free defer space it is dropped
  (not partially stored) and `IX` bit2 (data lost) is raised on the next RECV.
  With one MTU-sized frame per send window this does not occur in practice;
  **keeping SENDs short** (one line / one packet) keeps it that way.
- **Draining before sending** is no longer required for correctness, but is
  still a reasonable habit for latency-sensitive interactive loops.

The RTL backend has no such window (the card buffers receive independently), so
its consumers behave identically. (An ESP-only raw transparent pipe could still
be added behind the reserved `CAP_TRANSPARENT` bit and slots 20-23, but the
portable, now-lossless path is SEND/RECV.)

### Two channels

Backends with `CAP_MULTICHAN` hold two connections at once - channel 0 and
channel 1 - which is what passive FTP needs: commands and replies on the control
connection while the data connection transfers a file. Both current backends
support it (UNETESP through ESP-AT multi-connection mode, since 0.3; UNETRTL
since 0.2.5x). A future single-channel backend would not, so branch on the
capability bit rather than assuming it:

```
    GETCAPS                            ; DE bit4 (0x0010) = CAP_MULTICHAN
    CONNECT   chan 0, host, "21"       ; control
    ; ... login, TYPE I, PASV -> parse the 227 reply
    CONNECT   chan 1, pasv_host, pasv_port
    SEND      chan 0, "RETR file",13,10
loop:
    RECV      chan 1, buf, max, 4000 ms   ; data
    ; A=NERR_OK/DE>0   -> write DE bytes
    ; A=NERR_OK/DE=0   -> nothing yet; IX bit3 set means channel 0 has data
    ; A=NERR_CLOSED    -> server closed the data link: transfer complete
    RECV      chan 0, buf, max, 800 ms    ; picks up 150/226 whenever they came
    CLOSE     chan 1
    ; ... QUIT
    CLOSE     chan 0
    NETDONE                               ; also restores single-connection mode
```

Rules that make this work:

- **Read the channels in turn.** The backend reads one shared serial link, so a
  block that arrives for the channel you are *not* reading is buffered for it and
  the current read returns immediately with `DE=0` and `IX` bit3 set. That is a
  "switch channels" signal, not an idle link. `STATUS` reports the same thing
  (`0x04`) without consuming anything.
- **Order is preserved per channel.** Buffered data is always delivered before
  anything newer, and before that channel's `NERR_CLOSED`.
- **Both directions are safe while both channels are open.** Sending on the
  control channel during a data transfer is exactly the FTP pattern (`REST`,
  `RETR`, `STOR`, `LIST`), and data that arrives during those sends is captured
  the same way as in the single-channel case above.
- **Drain promptly.** Each channel has its own 2 KB buffer. If the channel you
  are ignoring receives more than that before you come back to it, the excess is
  dropped and flagged with `IX` bit2 on its next RECV. Alternating reads, keeping
  slow disk/screen work between them short, and using `RXPAUSE` around that work
  keeps the buffers shallow.
- **One thing at a time.** Do not call `CONNECT`, `RESOLVE` or `PING` while the
  peer on the other channel may transmit unprompted: those parse a line-based AT
  response and would consume peer data as text. In FTP this never happens - the
  data channel is opened between the `227` reply and the transfer command.

Uploads finish the other way round: the *client* closes the data channel to
signal end of file (`CLOSE` channel 1), then reads the `226` on the control
channel. `CLOSE` waits for the ESP's reply without swallowing peer data, so a
`226` racing the close is not lost.

## Avoiding UART overrun (ESP backend)

Lossless receive at speed depends on several layers; a consumer only has to
respect the last one:

1. **Hardware RTS/CTS on both sides.** `NETINIT` puts the 16550 in auto-flow
   mode with a 4-byte RX FIFO trigger and tells the ESP `flow=3`. When the
   FIFO fills, RTS drops in hardware and the ESP stops within a few byte-times;
   backpressure propagates through the ESP buffer and the TCP window.
2. **Command mode (+IPD), not transparent mode.** Frame boundaries give the ESP
   safe points to stop; a receive pause never corrupts a frame.
3. **RXPAUSE / RXRESUME - the consumer's job.** Before doing slow work between
   receives (writing to disk, repainting the screen), call RXPAUSE; call
   RXRESUME before the next RECV. `GETCAPS` bit `RXFLOW` tells you this backend
   needs it (the RTL backend does not - it buffers in the card and RXPAUSE is a
   no-op there, so the same consumer code is correct on both).
4. **Single owner of RTS.** The DLL never raises RTS on its own; it restores the
   pause state you set. Do not toggle RTS by any other means.

The default FIFO trigger is 4 bytes. The prior TR8 setting left only eight
byte-times for the ESP to observe RTS and caused periodic overruns in
SpecTalkZX. The "safer" 1-byte trigger throttles throughput to about 1 KB/s;
TR4 leaves 12 byte-times of headroom and is the tested default. `SETOPT RXTRIG`
can still select another trigger for field diagnostics.

## RTL backend appendix (UNETRTL.DLL - implementation guide)

The RTL8019A backend implements the *same* function numbers, error codes and
capability semantics, so a consumer is source-compatible. Implementation notes
for the sprinter-rtl8019a project:

- **Network up:** there is no `NET=WIFI` marker on RTL. Treat the network as up
  when `NET_IP` and `NET_MAC` are non-empty (published by `NETCFG -i` / `IFUP`).
  Recommended: also publish `NET=RTL` after bring-up (and remove it on
  `NETCFG -d`) so launchers can pick the DLL by `NET` value; still accept the
  legacy state (no `NET=`, but `NET_IP`+`NET_MAC` set).
- **NETINIT:** probe the card (honour `NET_RTL_HW`), then it is up.
- **CONNECT / SEND / RECV / CLOSE:** map onto the software stack -
  `RESOLVE.HOST` -> `RESOLVE.NEXT_HOP_FOR` -> `TCP.OPEN`, then `TCP.SEND` /
  `TCP.RECV` / `TCP.CLOSE`. SEND chunks at the TCP MSS (536); the ABI hides
  this exactly as UNETESP hides the 2048 CIPSEND cap.
- **RESOLVE:** software DNS via `dns_lib` / `resolve_lib`; format the A record
  as a dotted quad. `CAP_RESOLVE` is set and works (no `NERR_NOTSUP`).
- **PING:** software ICMP echo (as in the RTL `ping.asm`).
- **UDP:** connected UDP over the inline datagram framing used by the RTL
  UDPTEST / NTP / TFTP tools.
- **RXPAUSE / RXRESUME:** no-ops returning `NERR_OK`; the card buffers receive
  in its ~14.5 KB ring. Clear `CAP_RXFLOW`.
- **Capabilities:** UNETRTL 0.3.0 reports `0x023F` =
  `TCP | UDP | RESOLVE | PING | MULTICHAN | LISTEN | ASYNCSEND`.
  `CAP_RXFLOW` is off (no-op RXPAUSE/RXRESUME above); `CAP_RAWETH` is unset.
- **LISTEN / UNLISTEN:** passive TCP open is available with the same
  `CAP_LISTEN`/RECV-driven accept and automatic re-arm contract as UNETESP.
- **Two channels (passive FTP):** implemented on both backends. UNETESP does
  it through ESP-AT multi-connection mode (`AT+CIPMUX=1`, one receive buffer
  per channel, `NETDONE` restoring `CIPMUX=0`), since 0.3. UNETRTL does it
  with two independent TCP/UDP contexts (separate tuples, sequence state and
  a per-channel deferred-segment queue up to the 536-byte MSS): as inbound
  segments reach the head of the RTL receive ring they are processed and
  ACKed under their own channel's context, and `UNET_RXF_XCHAN` signals when
  the other channel needs servicing. See `sprinter-rtl8019a/docs/UNETRTL.md`
  ("Two channels") for the full detail.

## Changelog (sprinter_unet_libs_asm vendoring)

- Corrected several stale claims that UNETRTL lacks `CAP_MULTICHAN` /
  two-channel support. UNETRTL has reported `CAP_MULTICHAN` (via
  `GETCAPS` = `0x001F`) and implemented two independent TCP/UDP channel
  contexts since 0.2.5x; the upstream copy of this document (as of
  UNETESP 0.2.41 / UNETRTL 0.2.56) had not yet been updated to reflect
  that. The RTL backend appendix's capability/two-channel bullets and the
  "Two channels" section's opening paragraph were rewritten accordingly.
  When re-vendoring a newer upstream copy of this file, diff against this
  changelog to see whether upstream has since fixed these itself (in
  which case this changelog and its provenance note at the top can be
  dropped).
